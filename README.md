IMPOLS - IMplicit contents in POLitical Speech task @ EVALITA2026

## Description
The task IMPOLS focuses on the automatic recognition of implicit content in political speech. Given an utterance in a context, we ask participants to develop a system capable of detecting and classifying the implicit contents that are non-\textit{bona fide} true: these are implicit, questionable contents that are not conveyed in good faith but are still understood as true, albeit non-explicitly, within a given context. This kind of content is widely employed in political communication as a strategic tool to convey messages implicitly, thereby enabling the transmission of potentially manipulative content without overt expression.

We propose three subtasks: (1) a binary detection task, in which the systems are asked to detect the presence of questionable implicit contents in speech excerpts; (2) a binary classification task, in which the systems are asked to discriminate between two types of implicit contents: implicatures and presuppositions; (3) a multiclass classification task, in which the systems have to identify if implicatures are particularized conversational, generalized conversational, or conventional.

IMPOLS is a monolingual (Italian) multimodal task: both the speech and the manually revised transcription will be provided to the participants in the three subtasks.
